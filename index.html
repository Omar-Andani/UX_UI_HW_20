            <p>Kaeja d’Dance is a non-profit organization that has created award-winning contemporary dance performances for 
            stage, film, and communities for over 30 years. Whether you’re a dance enthusiast looking to get started or a seasoned

            <h3 class="mb-4">The Problem at Hand</h2>
            <p>Through conversations with our target audience, we were able to determine what their expectations were when 
            visiting a dance website. Our goal was to try and get into their minds and learn what they cared about. As we 
            reviewed our notes, it became evident that the current Kaeja website wasn’t meeting its users’ expectations. 
            It lacked a clear message as to the purpose of the organization, resulting in difficulty in users being able to 
            access key information.</p>
            <p>The site also lacked any sort of visual branding that one would expect when visiting a website of this nature; 
            it was neither dramatic nor elegant.</p>
            <p class="mb-5">Thus, we were left wondering:</p>
            <div class="howMightWe w-75 p-4 mx-auto mt-5 border-left border-white">
                <p class="mb-0"><span>How Might We</span> improve the interface and information architecture of the site in order to inspire dance enthusiasts 
                to spread their passion for dance to others?</p>

            <h3 class="mb-4">Defining the User Experience</h2>
            <p>We saw Kaeja as more than just a dance company. Their community involvement and <span class="redText"> mission to make dance accessible 
            to all</span> resonates with countless individuals - many of whom have no previous dance experience. Once our persona was 
            defined as a result of our interviews and secondary research we were then able to proceed in ideating the best      
            possible ways for users to accomplish their task.</p>
            <p>Due to time constraints, I focused on designing a specific user journey which led to an event called “Porch 
             View Dancing (PVD),” identified through our interviews as Kaeja’s most popular event.</p>

                    remembers dancing as a child and how much joy it brought her. Familiar with a dance company that is 
                    heavily involved within the community, she visits the Kaeja website and is drawn to 'Porch View Dancing' 
                    because it gives her the opportunity to receive free training from an experienced choreographer.</p>

            <h3 class="mb-4">Making Information Accessible</h2>
            <p>To better connect users with the information they need, we conducted a moderated card sorting activity to better 
                understand how the navigation should be improved. One of the key insights in our discovery process was learning that two 
                user groups,<span class="redText"> dance enthusiasts and donors have specific needs when visiting the Kaeja website.</span> Enthusiasts are looking for 
                a section providing them with information on how they can start dancing and donors are looking for a section containing a 
                repository of previous work. Both groups were explicitly addressed.</p>

                <p>After designing a new navigation then sketching a low-fidelity mockup, we were then able to develop and test our 
                mid-fidelity prototype. Our <span class="redText">user feedback</span> was mostly concerned with cross-platform consistency and having too much 
                text on the mobile version. Upon iteration, we then proceeded to add visual design elements to the site. <span class="redText">To bring focus 
                    to our content and replicate the feeling of being in a theatre,</span>  where all the focus is on performance, we went with a 
                dark theme maintained throughout.</p>

            <p>After testing the first version of our high-fidelity mockup and garnering feedback from our users, we proceeded 
            to make a Version B for both mobile and desktop. Notable differences in Version B included an all uppercase letter 
            navigation, modified button colours and transparency. Based on our A/B test results, the final design incorporates 
            elements from both Version A and Version B.</p>

        <div class="contrastKey w-50 p-5 mx-auto mb-5">
            <h4 class="text-uppercase">contrast is key</h4>
            <p class="mt-3">The ‘Learn More' button was modified in Version B <span class="redText">in order to provide a more minimalist look and added contrast 
                for the user.</span> It also proved to be more successful during our user tests. The same can be said for the arrows overtop 
                the image. Lastly, the bottom navigation. Initially (for Version A), we thought it would be a good idea to bring 
                attention to the “Donate” button which is why it was designed with a solid fill, but our users felt that this made it 
                look like it was being selected, which caused confusion. As a result, we modified to include additional contrast, based 
                on user preference as noted above.

            <p class="mt-3">We also went with an all uppercase global and local navigation for Version B in an attempt to improve 
                readability. What we discovered was that while all uppercase navigation proved effective for shorter strings of text 
                (i.e. two words or less), users found it difficult to read text that was any longer. Our final design (for both 
                desktop and mobile), includes <span class="redText"> all uppercase for the global navigation but the subsequent local navigation remains 
                lowercase.</span>
